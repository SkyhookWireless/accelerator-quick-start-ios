# Context Accelerator: Quick Start app for iOS

## Setup

We are using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies.

After cloning the project from git open Terminal window and navigate to the project folder, then

```
$ pod install
```

CocoaPods requires that you open the *Quick Start.xcworkspace*.

```
$ open "Quick Start.xcworkspace"
```

You must run the app on a device, as Core Location framework requires real GPS and WiFi hardware to operate properly.
